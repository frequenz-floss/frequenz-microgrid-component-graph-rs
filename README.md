A Rust library for modelling a microgrid as a Directed Acyclic Graph
(DAG) of electrical components, validating the topology, and generating
string formulas for aggregated metrics.

## Usage

The central type is [`ComponentGraph`], generic over user-supplied node
and edge types. Build one by passing iterators of components and
connections to [`ComponentGraph::try_new`], optionally with a
[`ComponentGraphConfig`] constructed via
[`ComponentGraphConfig::builder()`][builder].

## The `Node` and `Edge` traits

Because this crate is independent of any specific microgrid representation,
it doesn't know about the component and connection types and instead uses
traits to interact with them.

To be usable with [`ComponentGraph`], the component and connection types
must therefore implement the [`Node`] and [`Edge`] traits, respectively.
Check the rustdoc for these traits for sample implementations.

## Validation

[`try_new`][`ComponentGraph::try_new`] returns an [`Error`] unless the
input graph has exactly one root (a [`GridConnectionPoint`]), is fully
connected, acyclic, and obeys the per-category neighbor rules (e.g. a
battery has a battery inverter predecessor and no successors). Selected
checks downgrade to a `tracing::warn!` when the corresponding `allow_*`
flag is set on the config.

## Pass-through components

Several categories (transformers, breakers, converters, electrolyzers, HVAC,
capacitor banks, and similar non-metering interconnect components) are treated
as *pass-through*: validators and formula generators see the graph as if those
nodes weren't there, and the visible view described below hides them.
[`ComponentGraph::try_new`] emits a `tracing::warn!` for each pass-through node
so operators know what is being elided.

> **Warning:** Pass-through behavior exists for forward compatibility — when new
> component categories are introduced, the library treats it as transparent
> rather than failing validation of the whole graph.
>
> The trade-off is that a real misclassification can slip through unnoticed if
> the `tracing::warn!` output isn't being read; operators integrating this
> library should make sure those warnings are surfaced.

## Visible and raw views

The query API comes in two views. The *raw* view is the graph as given:
[`raw_components`] and [`raw_connections`] list every component and connection,
and [`raw_predecessors`] / [`raw_successors`] give the graph-direct neighbors.
The *visible* view hides pass-through components and components whose
operational mode is `Inactive`: [`visible_components`] skips them, and
[`visible_predecessors`] / [`visible_successors`] walk past them, so their
neighbors see each other directly. An inactive battery or hybrid inverter is not
walked through: it and every component only reachable through it are pruned from
the view. [`visible_connections`] pairs each visible component with its visible
successors as `(source_id, destination_id)`, so together with
[`visible_components`] it describes the visible graph.

The grid connection point stays visible whatever its mode, since hiding it would
hide the whole graph. Lookup by id via [`component`] resolves hidden components
too, while [`visible_predecessors`] / [`visible_successors`] called on a hidden
component yield nothing. [`ComponentGraph::try_new`] emits a `tracing::warn!`
for each inactive component and for each component the visible view hides.

Validators, formula generators and the meter role checks (`is_pv_meter` and
friends) keep seeing inactive components: an inactive meter still classifies its
chain, and formulas resolve it through its reporting children rather than
reading it.

## Formulas

Once constructed, the graph emits string formulas (e.g.
`#1 + COALESCE(#2, #3, 0.0)`) that downstream code can hand to a metric
evaluator:

- Aggregate: [`grid_formula`], [`consumer_formula`], [`producer_formula`].
- Per category: [`battery_formula`], [`pv_formula`], [`chp_formula`],
  [`wind_turbine_formula`], [`ev_charger_formula`], [`steam_boiler_formula`].
- Single component: [`component_formula`].
- Non-aggregating metrics (voltage, frequency): [`grid_coalesce_formula`],
  [`battery_ac_coalesce_formula`], [`pv_ac_coalesce_formula`],
  [`component_ac_coalesce_formula`].

For the per-category formulas, whether the meter or the device
measurement is the primary source is controlled by
[`prefer_meters_in_component_formulas`] on the config, with per-formula
overrides available through [`FormulaOverrides`].
