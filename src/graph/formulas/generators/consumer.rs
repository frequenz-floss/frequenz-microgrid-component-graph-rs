//! Generates the consumer formula: what the site's loads draw.
//!
//! There are three shapes, picked by configuration and then by topology:
//!
//! 1. With phantom loads configured in, every reporting meter contributes its
//!    residual, so power drawn by something the graph does not model still
//!    counts. See [`phantom_loads`].
//! 2. Otherwise, when every component directly under the grid is a grid meter
//!    that reports, the grid reading measures the site. See
//!    [`ConsumerFormulaBuilder::build_with_grid_meter`].
//! 3. Otherwise, the topmost reporting meters ([`meters::summed`]) measure it
//!    between them. See
//!    [`ConsumerFormulaBuilder::build_without_grid_meter`].
//!
//! Shapes 2 and 3 both measure whole lines and then subtract the non-consumer
//! chains sitting on them (see [`chains`]); they differ in what they measure
//! from, and so in which chains that measurement covers.
